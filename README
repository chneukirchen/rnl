NAME
     rnl – remove trailing newlines

SYNOPSIS
     rnl [-01sz] [files ...]

DESCRIPTION
     rnl removes trailing newlines from the specified input files.  The files

     output, removing trailing newlines.

     The options are as follows:

     -0      Remove all trailing newlines.

     -1      Remove just one trailing newline.

     -s      Strip all but one newline at the end.  (This is the default.)

     -z      Remove final NUL bytes instead of newlines.

EXIT STATUS
     The rnl utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
